        <h2>Why Are We Using The Term <b>Open Work</b>?</h2>
        <p class="subtitle">Goal of Open Work</p>
        <hr>
        <p>People produce and collaborate on all different types of work within academia and beyond. Different types of
            works can be released and developed among communities of practice in different ways.
            To treat each type of Open Work as its own silo hinders the ability for these works to be used
            interchangeably among each other.
            We use the term Open Work to talk about a larger theory of practice in which Works of all types are
            developed, distributed, and collaborated upon.</p>

    <p>An Open Work delineates the meaning of “Open” with respect to work products and projects that are released into
        the public domain or under a license recognized by an entity such as, but not limited to, the Open Source
        Initiative (OSI), the Free Software Foundation GNU, the Creative Commons (CC) or the Open Knowledge Foundation
        (OKF) with the intent of promoting a robust community of collaboration around the work itself and other work
        that it may interoperate with.</p>
